# Event-Registration-and-Attendance-System
Developed an Event Registration and Attendance System through PHP and MYSQL
The Event Registration and Attendance System is a versatile PHP/MySQLi project designed for organizations or businesses in need of an online or automated event registration and attendance system. This system features two user interfaces: the admin side and the registrar's side. It manages multiple upcoming events, complete with event schedules, venues, and details. Registration and attendance for events open automatically on the event date. Admins can assign one or more registrar users to handle event registration and attendee management. The admin can close registration and attendance when needed, and the system generates printable attendance reports for each event.
